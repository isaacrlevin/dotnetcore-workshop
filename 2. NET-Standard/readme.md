# Maximize Code Reuse With .NET Standard

> .NET everywhere! In this fun session, we'll explain exactly what .NET Standard is, then show how .NET Standard allows us to write the one .NET class and use it in the full .NET Framework and .NET.

## 1. Moving library code to a .NET Standard library
> Note: You can jump to the complete state for demo 1 and 2 by switching to the `result` branch.
1. Open Solution in Module 2 --> Labs --> netstandard-dataset-demo
1. Run the application and show that it's using an XML backed DataSet in a Windows Forms application. This application shows all Northwind employees that are now at retirement age.
1. Right-click the solution and add a .NET Standard Class Library to the solution.
1. Delete `Class1.cs` from the new .NET Standard project.
1. Drag the `NorthwindDb.cs` class and the `northwind.xml` file from the original project into the new .NET Standard project.
1. Add a project reference from the original project to the .NET Standard project.
1. Delete the `NorthwindDb.cs` class and the `northwind.xml` file from the original project.
1. Run the application and verify it still works.

## 2. Referencing an old NuGet package from a .NET Standard library
1. Add a reference to the `NQuery` package from the .NET Standard library.
1. Modify the `GetData()` method to use the `NQuery` library as shown below:
   ```csharp
        public static string GetData()
        {
            var result = "";
            var dataSet = new DataSet();
            dataSet.ReadXml(@"C:\demos\northwind.xml");

            var dataContext = new DataContext();
            dataContext.AddTablesAndRelations(dataSet);

            var sql = @"
                SELECT  e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName
                FROM    Employees e
                WHERE   e.Birthdate.AddYears(65) < GETDATE()
            ";

            var query = new Query(sql, dataContext);
            var results = query.ExecuteDataTable();
            var values = results.Rows.Cast<DataRow>().Select(r => (string)r[0]);
            result = string.Join(Environment.NewLine, values);

            return result;
        }
   ```
1. Run the application and demonstrate that the reference to the NuGet package is working due to the .NET Standard compatability shim.
